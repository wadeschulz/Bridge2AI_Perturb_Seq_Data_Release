Read up on the data structure of [AnnData objects](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and explore the .obs/.var of the downloaded data. The .X is the X_pert layer computed by [pertpy](https://pertpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/notebooks/mixscape.html), and is filtered down to top 6000 highly variable genes.\n",

    "5. Read on generally what [UMAP](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) does. Use the correlation matrix as a precomputed feature matrix as input to UMAP to get a 2-dimensional embedding of each perturbation. 6. Use the nearest n=3 neighbors with spread = 1.0 to compute the UMAP.\n",
    "7. Use [networkx](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/tutorial.html) to plot each perturbation as a node, using the UMAP embeddings as the X/Y position of each node. Draw edges between each node and the top 5 person correlates.\n",
    "8. What perturbations cluster together in the network? Do these have known biological relationships? How does the clustering change as a function of changing the number of UMAP neighbors?"
